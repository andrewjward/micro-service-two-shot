## Shoes microservice

The front-end of the application contains a list of shoes as well as forms for creating new shoes, although the add and delete are not fully functional at this time. The back-end programming allows for the generation of shoe containers as well as shoe containers themselves. Forms for entering a shoe manufacturer, model name, color, picture URL, and bin number are also included in the application, as is the action of deleting it. They can be reached through the links in the navigation bar.

## Hats microservice
