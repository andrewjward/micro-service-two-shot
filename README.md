## Design

## Shoes microservice

Created front-end of the application with react that contains a list of shoes and forms for creating new shoes, although the add/create is not fully functional at this time. The back-end programming allows for the creation of shoe bins, we used a poller for the backend so the front-end can receive the VO data. The ShoeForm allows the user the enter the shoe manufacturer, model name, color, picture URL, and bin number are in the application, with a delete option.

## Hats microservice

Explain your models and integration with the wardrobe
microservice, here.
